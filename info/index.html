				The RoboWarriors' robot was built using three subteams- Mechanical, Programming, and Electrical. Each subteam had to communicate extensively with other subteams in order to be able to form their own components and combine them together to work as one robot. Below is a description of what each of the subteams have done this year: <br/><br/>

					<h2>Mineral Sweeper</h2>
				<br>
The mineral sweeper was made in order to pick the minerals that are contained inside the craters in the corners of the field. A key aspect of this device is that it must be able to extend over the crater by itself. In other words, the robot would not need to partially or completely enter the crater in order for the minerals to be removed.
	Our first decision to make was how the balls would be picked up from within the crater. In previous years we have tried using a shovel-like scoop method with some sort of bucket attached to an arm on a motor or servo. While the simplicity of this design is advantageous for maintenance, the speed and consistency at which objects can be picked up is unacceptable. In other years we have tried claw or clamp methods using a servo connected to one side of claw to squeeze an object. While this method does not drop the object as frequently as the scoop method, it requires a lot more maintenance and precision. The other major difficulty with a clamp method is the time it takes the driver and gunner to align and pick up a the given object. Learning from our previous mistakes, we decided to go with a sweeper method with some sort of flexible material attached to an axle which hits the object up and into a containment area.
				<br>
	The second major decision to make was what string-like material would be used on the axel. The key is that the material firm enough to push the mineral but not so strong that it cannot rap around the block. Also, if the material is much too firm the block can be thrown out of the container at high speeds posing a threat to both the robot and surrounding people. Our first thought was zip-ties because they are inexpensive and easy to attach to an axel. This quickly proved a suboptimal solution because the zip-ties did not provide enough resistance to move the minerals. After having a very flexible and light option we went to the other extreme and used a coiled plastic cable which had some flex but was very stiff especially compared to the weak zip-ties. These plastic pieces were throwing the blocks out and were clearly not going to work. our third and final solution was flexible rubber tubing which combined the perfect weight and flexibility to push the balls and cubes into the 3D printed containment area with out launching them out.
				<br>
	After these major decisions were made, our final design started to come to fruition. We mounted the axle to a gear which was connected to a servo via a chain. This sweeper pushes the minerals into a 3D printed containment area which directs the block into our main arm system. This system allows quick collection of two minerals with accuracy from the driver or gunner and without forcing the robot to climb over the crater walls. 
				<br>
	At first our walls were made of cardboard and foam board which were light but also very flimsy so we quickly identified a need for improvement. Metal is much too heavy to be a viable solution do to the length the linear slide will be extending. At the maximum length.

<h2>Pivot Arm</h2>
<br>
The pivot arm of the robot performs the task of lifting the robot and moving minerals from the ground level to the lander. This was one of the first challenges we addressed, and it proved to be difficult. We started by brainstorming designs, including a scissor arm, an extender arm, and a swinging arm, which we eventually settled on. In order to move the minerals, the arm uses a tetrix motor with encoder feedback to rotate between the two set points. Additionally, the pivot arm uses a winch for lifting the robot on and off the lander. The winch is attached to the top of the pivot arm via a string. The winch pulls on the arm using this string. This uses a servo-operated locking mechanism, that keeps the robot from landing prematurely. 
				<br>
Originally, we were planning on the pivot arm directly lifting the robot with one motor, but it wasnâ€™t  strong enough. With the sting the winch was able to gain a greater mechanical advantage and was able to successfully lift the robot. We also had issues with the arm as it hit the rest of the robot, especially the motor of the front wheels. We changed the design so that it used a winch instead, which was much more effective. We also had problems with the pivot arm not fitting inside the size parameters, hitting the robot, or not being able to reach the lander, so we had to adjust the height, position and length of the arm multiple times. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Pivot Arm Head</h2>
<br>
The pivot arm head is attached to the end of the pivot arm and it is responsible for transferring the minerals from the sweeper into the lander. For our pivot arm head, we had a prototype that was made from aluminum parts, but ended up 3-D printing a new part. It uses a group of beams that support the two ends of the head, which makes it stronger, and can remain reliable after heavy use. The arm is attached to the lifting arm with an axle which allows the head of the arm to rotate up into position after launch. Surgical tubing connects the free end of the arm to the lifting arm. This tubing provides tension so that, when the robot lowers down off of the hook, the arm swings into the upright position and locks. The Pivot Arm locks into the upright position with a 3D printed part. Originally the lock took the form of a latching mechanism in which a metal beam fell into a cut notch in the axle. Tension was put onto the latch via a spring which ensured that the latch was constantly pushing against the axle. In the end this design had too many inconsistencies and had to be abandoned. The major issue was with the mounting of the latching mechanism; due to the positioning of the latch it was difficult to mount it properly without bending. The solution was to 3D-print a part which would allow a standoff to be locked inside of a set of jaws. This solution was far smaller in profile and therefore was comparatively simple to mount onto the robot arm.<br> 
This mechanism was necessary because of size limitations. With our original design we realized that the arm did not fit inside of the size restrictions when it was attached to the lander in the upright position. The issue was that the arm extended too far and did not fit in the allotted space. We could not, however, simply reduce the length of the robot arm itself because then the arm would not be tall enough to reach all the way up to the top of the lander in order to deliver the minerals. The pivot arm solves this problem by allowing the arm to fit within the size restrictions but then also extend to the necessary height after the robot lowers itself off of the launcher.<br> 
After creating this part we also encountered challenges with making it so that the minerals properly fell into the lander. The issue was that the balls would fly out of the head of the arm when the arm reached its apex. When this happened the balls and cubes would fall into the opponentâ€™s containers. In order to solve this we employed two solutions. The first solution was to tip the head of the robot down. This helped because it prevented the balls from falling out of the robot head. Now, when the head reached the lander, it hit the top part of the lander and prevented the balls from falling out as much. This did not entirely fix the problem as the balls were prevented from exiting the head but sometimes the cubes still made it through the opening. <br>
Because of this we implemented another solution; we decided to add a metal lip to the top side of the robot arm head. To do this we simply affixed a small bar of metal on either end to the top of the head (when it is in the up position). This addition served to further close the opening when the head contacted the lander at the top. This served to finally fix the problem of the balls and cubes falling into different locations on the lander than were intended. The lip prevented even the cubes from flying out of the head when it came into contact with the lander while delivering the balls and cubes.

<h2>Auton</h2>
<br>
Our auton team started off by working on computer vision. Working with OpenCV, we developed a way to detect the relative positions of the three minerals to knock over. Then, we spent a bit attempting to use OpenCV to detect the //TODO
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Tele-Op</h2>
				<br>
Our tele-op team began by copying everything over from last yearâ€™s programming. With a nontrivial amount of deliberation, we figured out what everything was supposed to do. Then, we started trying to control the new motors specific to this yearâ€™s competition; the winch and winch-locking mechanism for lifting and landing, the two arms for manipulating the minerals, and so forth.
